## What is this?
This is ideas I've had for GTFS stuff! Support in my [interpreter](https://github.com/ShadowFoxNixill/GTFS-Interpreter) is planned for all of these.

## Something doesn't make sense.
Raise an issue! I'd be happy to hear your feedback. You can also reach me at [@ShadowFoxNixill on Twitter](https://twitter.nixill.net/).

## Compatibility
All of these proposals aim to be backwards compatible with the [current standard](https://developers.google.com/transit/gtfs/reference/), but may not be 100% compatible (also see [prereqs.md](prereqs.md)).

## Notes on requirements
All tables added by proposals are *optional*. The same goes for columns added to existing tables. A GTFS feed is perfectly valid without taking any of these proposals into account.
